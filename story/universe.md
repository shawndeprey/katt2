Intro:
In a galaxy called Andromeda, the indigenous people of a planet called Luminous find themselves on the brink of annihilation. Long friends from a sister galaxy called the Milky Way have turned enemy on the order of Jett Murik, the new leader of a planet called Earth. Athanas, accomplished captain, pilot and space battle veteran leads a last ditch military effort to push through Jett's forces to negotiate peace between the two galaxies.

Athanas and her crew:
Athanas is joined by 5 expert crew members on this most important of missions. The first is Dydra, a very skilled pilot and tactician who has been serving along side Athanas for a more than 7 years. Next is Eonestra, Luminous' most experienced and battle hardened weapons expert. Athanas, Dydra and Eonestra are all natural born Luminions, much in contrast to their befriended Earth born crew mates.

The first of Athanas' Earth born crew is Sophia Newman, an extremely talented scientist specializing in shield generator technology. Next is Sato Shintaro, a well educated and experienced engineer. Finally we have Burtsov Valerian, a man of large stature and personality. Burtsov is all too fond of cooking fine cuisines, a skill of demand among space crews.


Plot Points:
Burstov Valerian is a curious, gruff, kind-hearted, and colorful man. Throughout the story, he ends up coming out.


Flavor:
Joke about Athanas: "Athanas, we were wondering... How long does it take you to do you hair every day?"
Joke about characters: Everybody is overly sexualized/half-naked, NO MODESTY. EXCEPT.... that one guy who seems out of place in the universe, and is like, 'why the fuck isn't anybody wearing clothes?'
Trigger Warning: This game is an equal opportunity SEXYist. If the human form triggers you, close the game, uninstall and send us hate mail.
